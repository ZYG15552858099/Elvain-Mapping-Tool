# v1.0 Elvain Tool

- After a month of work, the developer have completed the Elvain Tool version 1.0. In this update, the developer has improved the component to extract points and threads from Caribous; Categorize each component and describe its function; Adding a component that can generate the change of elements through the sliding slider to predict the change of different types of parking areas in the future; Adding a UI Page component that digitally visualizes these predicted changes makes it easier for users to see the magnitude of the changes.

## The Third Part

### Time Slider

- The first technology to be added was Time Slider. This part mainly predicts the change rule of the existing urban parking Area and Apartments Area in the future through the location and quantity relationship between them.

- Different from the components in the second part, the components in the third part extract the information of urban parking areas. They show the changes of the types and locations of urban parking areas in the future by changing the number from 0 to 100 on a slider. This slider is similar to a timeline, and the user slides the slider to change the time.

### Changes of Surface Parking Area

- The components in this picture show the transformation of the surface parking area in the future. When the slider number reaches 100, more than 90% of the above-ground parking area will be transformed into underground parking, bicycle parking area and parking buildings.

### Legend

- Legend was also created and placed in Rhino to help users quickly identify different types of parking areas.

### Areas of Parking Area

- The component in this figure is a prediction of the network formed by each of the four parking areas. As the number on the time slider changes from 1 to 100, the network in the above-ground parking area gradually decreases, while the network in the other three parking areas gradually increases.

## The Fourth Part

### UI Page Introduction

- The component in this section creates a UI Page in Rhino that shows the ratio of the number of parking Spaces to future changes. The first bar chart shows the current number of four parking areas in a city. The second bar chart shows that the areas of the other three parking areas change with time, except the above-ground parking area.
