## Intruduction

This Grasshopper tools help **YOU** to identify the position relations between Parking Area and Residential Area.Instead of directly showing the coordinates of residential and parking areas in the city, these tools help you understand whether the distribution of residential areas affects the distribution of parking areas in different cities!

## Example

Point of Parking and Apartment Areas in Manila and London.

The points show the distribution and extent of influence of the two areas.

The distribution of rivers will affect residential areas and indirectly affect the distribution of small car parks

## Use

- Step 1 Creating maps document from **OpenStreetMap**, then load the map file into Grasshopper.
- Step 2 Check for **Parking**, **Apartment** and other research things in Caribous and check the keywords to show them
- Step 3 Use **Gird Field**, **Voronoi** and other GH battery packs to demonstrate the location relationship of areas

## Closest Point

It is also a method to find the distribution law of the parking areas to divide the city into several areas through the closest boundaries.
