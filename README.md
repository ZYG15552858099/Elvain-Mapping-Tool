# v0.9 Elvain Tool

## Intruduction

This Grasshopper tools help **YOU** to identify the position relations between Parking Area and Residential Area.Instead of directly showing the coordinates of residential and parking areas in the city, these tools help you understand whether the distribution of residential areas affects the distribution of parking areas in different cities!

## Example

When **YOU** enter the map into **File Path**, you need to bake the important information Caribous pulls out and enter the points and curves in the battery pack below. Rhino generates the texture of the city and shows where the parking area, bicycle parking area and residential area are located

## Use

- Step 1 Creating maps document from **OpenStreetMap**, then load the map file into Grasshopper. Then check for **Parking**, **Apartment** and other research things in **Specify Features** and check the keywords to show them

- Step 2 Bake out the desired points and curves and then identify them into the battery pack in the picture

## Closest Point

It is also a method to find the distribution law of the parking areas to divide the city into several areas through the closest boundaries.
