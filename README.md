# v1.0 Elvain Tool

## Introduction

V1.0 Elvain Tool helps users discover the changes in the number and area of parking areas in the city over time. It also visualizes changing numbers through bar charts on the UI Page.

## Example of Time Slider

- This part mainly predicts the change rule of the existing urban parking Area and Apartments Area in the future through the location and quantity relationship between them.

- Take the port of Manila as an example. This is the current distribution of parking areas in Manila. It can be seen that Manila has many above-ground parking areas, but other parking areas are very few.

### Example of UI Page

- The component in this section creates a UI Page in Rhino that shows the ratio of the number of parking Spaces to future changes. The first bar chart shows the current number of four parking areas in a city. The second bar chart shows that the areas of the other three parking areas change with time, except the above-ground parking area.
